Under Kubiak, the Broncos planned to install a run-oriented offense with zone blocking to blend in with quarterback Peyton Manning's shotgun passing skills, but struggled with numerous changes and injuries to the offensive line, as well as Manning having his worst statistical season since his rookie year with the Indianapolis Colts in 1998, due to a plantar fasciitis injury in his heel that he had suffered since the summer, and the simple fact that Manning was getting old, as he turned 39 in the 2015 off-season. Although the team had a 7\u20130 start, Manning led the NFL in interceptions. In week 10, Manning suffered a partial tear of the plantar fasciitis in his left foot. He set the NFL's all-time record for career passing yards in this game, but was benched after throwing four interceptions in favor of backup quarterback Brock Osweiler, who took over as the starter for most of the remainder of the regular season. Osweiler was injured, however, leading to Manning's return during the Week 17 regular season finale, where the Broncos were losing 13\u20137 against the 4\u201311 San Diego Chargers, resulting in Manning re-claiming the starting quarterback position for the playoffs by leading the team to a key 27\u201320 win that enabled the team to clinch the number one overall AFC seed. Under defensive coordinator Wade Phillips, the Broncos' defense ranked number one in total yards allowed, passing yards allowed and sacks, and like the previous three seasons, the team has continued to set numerous individual, league and franchise records.

After the Third Partition of Poland in 1795, Warsaw was incorporated into the Kingdom of Prussia. In 1806 during the Napoleonic Wars, the city became the official capital of the Grand Duchy of Warsaw, a puppet state of the First French Empire established by Napoleon Bonaparte. In accordance with the decisions of the Congress of Vienna, the Russian Empire annexed Warsaw in 1815 and it became part of the \"Congress Kingdom\". Only in 1918 did it regain independence from the foreign rule and emerge as a new capital of the independent Republic of Poland. The German invasion in 1939, the massacre of the Jewish population and deportations to concentration camps led to the uprising in the Warsaw ghetto in 1943 and to the major and devastating Warsaw Uprising between August and October 1944. Warsaw gained the title of the \"Phoenix City\" because it has survived many wars, conflicts and invasions throughout its long history. Most notably, the city required painstaking rebuilding after the extensive damage it suffered in World War II, which destroyed 85% of its buildings.

For small n, say 100, and assuming for the sake of example that the computer does 1012 operations each second, the program would run for about 4 \u00d7 1010 years, which is the same order of magnitude as the age of the universe. Even with a much faster computer, the program would only be useful for very small instances and in that sense the intractability of a problem is somewhat independent of technological progress.

However, average teacher salaries have improved rapidly in recent years. US teachers are generally paid on graduated scales, with income depending on experience. Teachers with more experience and higher education earn more than those with a standard bachelor's degree and certificate. Salaries vary greatly depending on state, relative cost of living, and grade taught. Salaries also vary within states where wealthy suburban school districts generally have higher salary schedules than other districts. The median salary for all primary and secondary teachers was $46,000 in 2004, with the average entry salary for a teacher with a bachelor's degree being an estimated $32,000. Median salaries for preschool teachers, however, were less than half the national median for secondary teachers, clock in at an estimated $21,000 in 2004. For high school teachers, median salaries in 2007 ranged from $35,000 in South Dakota to $71,000 in New York, with a national median of $52,000.

In a salary survey report for K-12 teachers, elementary school teachers had the lowest median salary earning $39,259. High school teachers had the highest median salary earning $41,855. Many teachers take advantage of the opportunity to increase their income by supervising after-school programs and other extracurricular activities.

He left law school, sold his books, and entered a closed Augustinian cloister in Erfurt on 17 July 1505. One friend blamed the decision on Luther's sadness over the deaths of two friends. Luther himself seemed saddened by the move. Those who attended a farewell supper walked him to the door of the Black Cloister. \"This day you see me, and then, not ever again,\" he said.

Luther based his position on predestination on St. Paul's epistle to the Ephesians 2:8\u201310. Against the teaching of his day that the righteous acts of believers are performed in cooperation with God, Luther wrote that Christians receive such righteousness entirely from outside themselves; that righteousness not only comes from Christ but actually is the righteousness of Christ, imputed to Christians (rather than infused into them) through faith. \"That is why faith alone makes someone just and fulfills the law,\" he wrote. \"Faith is that which brings the Holy Spirit through the merits of Christ.\" Faith, for Luther, was a gift from God; the experience of being justified by faith was \"as though I had been born again.\" His entry into Paradise, no less, was a discovery about \"the righteousness of God\" \u2013 a discovery that \"the just person\" of whom the Bible speaks (as in Romans 1:17) lives by faith.

Contemporary Lutheran scholarship, however, has found a different reality in Luther. Luther rather seeks to separate faith and reason in order to honor the separate spheres of knowledge that each applies to. Bernhard Lohse, for example, has demonstrated in his classic work \"Fides und Ratio\" that Luther ultimately sought to put the two together. More recently, Hans-Peter Grosshans has demonstrated that Luther's work on Biblical Criticism stresses the need for external coherence in the right exegetical method. This means that for Luther it is more important that the Bible is reasonable according to the reality outside of the scriptures than that the Bible makes sense to itself, that it has internal coherence. The right tool for understanding the world outside of the Bible for Luther is none other than reason, which for him is the field of science, philosophy, history and empirical observation.

In his later years, Luther grew more hostile toward the Jews, writing against them with the kind of venom he had already unleashed on the Anabaptists, Zwinglianism, and the papacy.

He consistently rejected the idea of a Holy War, \"as though our people were an army of Christians against the Turks, who were enemies of Christ. This is absolutely contrary to Christ's doctrine and name\". On the other hand, in keeping with his doctrine of the two kingdoms, Luther did support non-religious war against the Turks. In 1526, he argued in Whether Soldiers can be in a State of Grace that national defence is reason for a just war. By 1529, in On War against the Turk, he was actively urging Emperor Charles V and the German people to fight a secular war against the Turks. He made clear, however, that the spiritual war against an alien faith was separate, to be waged through prayer and repentance.

Some scholars see Luther's influence as limited, and the Nazis' use of his work as opportunistic.

Uwe Siemon-Netto agreed, arguing that it was because the Nazis were already anti-Semites that they revived Luther's work. Hans J. Hillerbrand agreed that to focus on Luther was to adopt an essentially ahistorical perspective of Nazi antisemitism that ignored other contributory factors in German history.

The rotors have a propeller-like arrangement of blades at the outer edge. Steam acts upon these blades, producing rotary motion. The stator consists of a similar, but fixed, series of blades that serve to redirect the steam flow onto the next rotor stage. A steam turbine often exhausts into a surface condenser that provides a vacuum. The stages of a steam turbine are typically arranged to extract the maximum potential work from a specific velocity and pressure of steam, giving rise to a series of variably sized high- and low-pressure stages. Turbines are only efficient if they rotate at relatively high speed, therefore they are usually connected to reduction gearing to drive lower speed applications, such as a ship's propeller. In the vast majority of large electric generating stations, turbines are directly connected to generators with no reduction gearing. Typical speeds are 3600 revolutions per minute (RPM) in the USA with 60 Hertz power, 3000 RPM in Europe and other countries with 50 Hertz electric power systems. In nuclear power applications the turbines typically run at half these speeds, 1800 RPM and 1500 RPM. A turbine rotor is also only capable of providing power when rotating in one direction.

It was found that steam turbines were not ideally suited to the railroad environment and these locomotives failed to oust the classic reciprocating steam unit in the way that modern diesel and electric traction has done.[citation needed]", "qas": [{"answers": [{"answer_start": 67, "text": "water"}, {"answer_start": 67, "text": "water"}, {"answer_start": 67, "text": "water"}], "question": "What do nuclear power plants heat to create electricity?", "id": "571166352419e314009555f1"}, {"answers": [{"answer_start": 104, "text": "turbine"}, {"answer_start": 104, "text": "turbine"}, {"answer_start": 102, "text": "a turbine connected to an electrical generator"}], "question": "What does the steam generated by a nuclear power plant drive?", "id": "571166352419e314009555f2"}, {"answers": [{"answer_start": 128, "text": "electrical generator"}, {"answer_start": 128, "text": "electrical generator"}, {"answer_start": 354, "text": "a turbo generator set with propulsion provided by electric motors"}], "question": "In a nuclear power plant, what is the steam turbine connected to?", "id": "571166352419e314009555f3"}, {"answers": [{"answer_start": 302, "text": "turbo-electric transmission"}, {"answer_start": 302, "text": "turbo-electric transmission,"}, {"answer_start": 302, "text": "turbo-electric transmission"}], "question": "What is it called when steam propels a turbo generator with electric motor propulsion?", "id": "571166352419e314009555f4"}, {"answers": [{"answer_start": 644, "text": "Britain"}, {"answer_start": 644, "text": "Britain"}, {"answer_start": 644, "text": "Britain"}], "question": "Where were non-condensing direct-drive locomotives notably used for fast passenger trains?", "id": "571166352419e314009555f5"}]}, {"context": "The Rankine cycle is sometimes referred to as a practical Carnot cycle because, when an efficient turbine is used, the TS diagram begins to resemble the Carnot cycle. The main difference is that heat addition (in the boiler) and rejection (in the condenser) are isobaric (constant pressure) processes in the Rankine cycle and isothermal (constant temperature) processes in the theoretical Carnot cycle. In this cycle a pump is used to pressurize the working fluid which is received from the condenser as a liquid not as a gas. Pumping the working fluid in liquid form during the cycle requires a small fraction of the energy to transport it compared to the energy needed to compress the working fluid in gaseous form in a compressor (as in the Carnot cycle). The cycle of a reciprocating steam engine differs from that of turbines because of condensation and re-evaporation occurring in the cylinder or in the steam inlet passages.", "qas": [{"answers": [{"answer_start": 48, "text": "practical Carnot cycle"}, {"answer_start": 48, "text": "practical Carnot cycle"}, {"answer_start": 46, "text": "a practical Carnot cycle"}], "question": "What is the Rankine cycle sometimes called?", "id": "5711669550c2381900b54adf"}, {"answers": [{"answer_start": 240, "text": "in the condenser"}, {"answer_start": 240, "text": "in the condenser"}, {"answer_start": 240, "text": "in the condenser"}], "question": "Where does heat rejection occur in the Rankine cycle?", "id": "5711669550c2381900b54ae0"}, {"answers": [{"answer_start": 272, "text": "constant pressure"}, {"answer_start": 272, "text": "constant pressure"}, {"answer_start": 272, "text": "constant pressure"}], "question": "What does isobaric mean?", "id": "5711669550c2381900b54ae1"}, {"answers": [{"answer_start": 326, "text": "isothermal"}, {"answer_start": 326, "text": "isothermal"}, {"answer_start": 326, "text": "isothermal"}], "question": "What is a term that means constant temperature?", "id": "5711669550c2381900b54ae2"}, {"answers": [{"answer_start": 506, "text": "liquid"}, {"answer_start": 504, "text": "a liquid"}, {"answer_start": 704, "text": "gaseous"}], "question": "In the Rankine cycle, in what state is the working fluid received in the condenser?", "id": "5711669550c2381900b54ae3"}]}]}]}
